# RefreshedAscii

## Description

On a boring sunday morning (precisely October the 13th 2024) I was waiting for the SpaceX to make the history once again and decided to create this simple yet funny tool.
The **Refreshed ASCII Art Converter** is a console application that allows you to convert images into ASCII art. It is designed to be easy to use and provides a unique visual experience through ASCII text.
<br/>
Oh, and for instance, [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGC31lmdS6s) was the coolest thing ever! 

## Features

- Convert images to ASCII art.
- Save ASCII art as a JPEG file.
- Intuitive user interface through the console.
- Custom logo rendered in ASCII art.

## Requirements

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version 6.0 or higher).
